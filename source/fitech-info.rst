======================

.. important::

   This course will be shut down on 31 March 2025.  To get credits,
   please submite your request before that date.  All material will
   continue to remain available indefinitely.  Some of the material is
   part of other open online courses which may interest you, see
   https://coderefinery.org and https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/

   If you are already a student at Aalto University, you should use the
   simpler procedure at :doc:`study-credits`.


How to start
------------

Hands-on scientific computing is a self-study course where you can reflect on your 
needs and determine what is useful for you. Modules have been structured from A to F
in a way that the difficultness level rises gradually.  

If you only wish to browse the materials, you can freely do so. 
If you wish to acquire credits or a certificate, you should read on.

.. note::

   If you are at Aalto University, these steps are not needed: you can
   log in to the exercise system with your existing Aalto account and
   request credits from scip@aalto.fi directly.

Exercises
---------

Our exercise page can be found here: `A+ Hands-on scientific computing`_.

.. _A+ Hands-on scientific computing: https://plus.cs.aalto.fi/CS-E4004/2020/

Logging in is required to submit the exercises, so you should log in
as "External to Aalto".

Course evaluation is divided into modules A-C and D-E and you can earn
1 credit from each modules (overall 2 credits). Instead of credits
users may also request a certificate after approved completion of
course.

More information about the grading practicalities and the exercises can be found on the exercise page.

Although the course is an always open course, notice that the content
and exercises might change over time and your performance may not be
valid anymore. Please make sure to finish your work in six months time
to secure successful completion of the course.
