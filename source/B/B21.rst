Jupyter Notebook is part of the Project Jupyter together with JupyterHub and JupyterLab. It provides
an online environment for creating documents which can contain executable code, explanatory text and other
resources (e.g. graphs). 

Jupyter Notebook is good for teaching, demonstrating and sharing ideas and testing out examples in browser.
With a large codebase and more advanced projects it is better to seek out other options as version control and
automated testing become harder. 


Installation
-----------

If you have installed Anaconda, Jupyter should already be installed on your machine. 
See that your Jupyter installation is working by typing ``jupyter-notebook`` in the shell. JupyterLab can be launched by typing ``jupyter-lab``. 

See `here <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter/#how-to-verify-the-installation>`_ for optional
extensions you can install in the notebooks.
