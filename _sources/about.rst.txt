About
=====

Hands-on Scientific Computing is a guide for all researchers and students
who have demanding computing needs.

* It can be browsed as needed or as a reference for people working independently.

* It can (in the future) be used as a self-study course to bridge the
  gap between academic study and independent research.

* You do not have to enroll in this course unless you wish to be graded. 

Hands-on Scientific Computing is a course born out of Aalto University
Science-IT, `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`__, and many
other inspirations.  Initial funding is provided by an Aalto Online
Learning grant.

Design and development
----------------------

This is an open project, which means we encourage contributions from
everyone and also accept that we have some compromises to make it
generally useful.  For local site customizations, we have a templating
system using the ``site/`` directory, so that we can have the same
source but every site can have their local customizations.

The `CONTRIBUTING file
<https://github.com/coderefinery/handsonscicomp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`__
explains in easy terms how to contribute specific things.


The `DESIGN file
<https://github.com/coderefinery/handsonscicomp/blob/master/DESIGN.rst>`__
explains how we structure the levels, modules, and information within
the modules.

The `README file
<https://github.com/coderefinery/handsonscicomp/blob/master/README.rst>`__
lists technical information about contributing.
