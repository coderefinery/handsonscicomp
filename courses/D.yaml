- id: C20 Modules and software
  desc: Using and installing software on a cluster is different from
    your own computer, because hundreds of people are sharing it.
    Modules are the solution.

- id: C22 HPC Storage
  desc: Storage turns out to be just as important as computing power.
    There are different places available, each with different
    advantages.
