For FITech users
================

How to start
------------

Hands-on scientific computing is a self-study course where you can reflect on your 
needs and determine what is useful for you. Modules have been structured from A to F
in a way that the difficultness level rises gradually.  

If you only wish to browse the materials, you can freely do so. 
If you wish to acquire credits or a certificate, you should read on.

Exercises
---------

You should have your Aalto account ready (provided by FITech). 

Our exercise page can be found here: `A+ Hands-on scientific computing`_.

Logging in is required to submit the exercises, so you should log in as "Aalto University user" which
is also for FITech users with an account.

Course evaluation is divided into modules A-C and D-E and you can earn 1 credit from each modules (overall 2 credits). 
Instead of credits users may also request a certificate after approved completion of course. 

More information about the grading practicalities and the exercises can be found on the exercise page. 

Although the course is an always open course, notice that the content and exercises might change
over time and your performance may not be valid anymore. Please make sure to finish your work in six months
time to secure successful completion of the course.
