Study credits (Aalto)
=====================

.. seealso::

   If you are in Finland but not Aalto, :doc:`you can get credits via the
   free FITech program <fitech-info>`.

You can earn credits from completing this course by doing exercises
(if you are in Finland at least).
One credit comes from completing exercises for levels A, B and C. A second credit can be earned by
completing exercises for D and E.

Exercises (and this course in general) are designed to make you
experience these tools, but are only a starting point to exploration.

Instructions if you are at Aalto University:

* The course material is on this page, and can be browsed at your own pace.
* `Log in to the exercise system kept separately
  <https://plus.cs.aalto.fi/CS-E4004/2020/>`__.  You need to attempt at least 90% of
  the exercises and pass at least 50%.  You may do this at your own
  pace.
* Note that exercises are subject to change, even though the course is
  continuous the exercises may change if you delay completing the
  course for too long.
* Request grading and by the `instructions in section 1.1
  <https://plus.cs.aalto.fi/CS-E4004/2020/01_introduction/01_instructions/>`__.
