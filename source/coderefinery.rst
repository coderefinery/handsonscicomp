CodeRefinery
============

`CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`__ is a course on tools
needed to do efficient research software development.
In-person and online courses are occasionally
offered, however, all material + videos are available online.  This
page collects this material so that you can study on your own.

This page contains an index to all material in one place, in the order
it is actually presented, and updated with the current "best" material
as we produce new versions of videos / material.


How to use this material
------------------------

You may go through this at your own page: written and video material
are roughly the same and compliment each other; use one or the other
or both in whatever order suits your styles.

* **Written lesson material** could be used without the videos.
* **Videos** are self-sufficient for an overview but to do examples you
  also want to open the written material.  They are portrait-mode so
  that you can adjust your screen to have half of it for you.
* **Q&A** are the live Q&A/notes asked by workshop attendees and
  answered during the workshop, and are optional (could be used for
  advanced study).

In the Hands-on Scientific Computing scheme, most of this material is
the E-level, with the git-intro being C-level.  This page is outside
of the main Hands-on SciComp flow and there are no credits directly
offered for this page.



Git introduction
----------------

The git version control system, from the very basics.  How to use it
well for your own projects.

Reproducible research and FAIR data
-----------------------------------

It is easy to do things once, but it's important to be able to do
them many times, or for others to be able to do them.

* `Lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/>`__
* `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxZF1gEJoWw&list=PLpLblYHCzJACm0Nz8ZxmdC6F8UuSYwWGQ&index=8>`__

Social coding and open software
-------------------------------

Eventually, you need to use the code or results that someone else has
made - or need for others to be able to use your creations!

* `Lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/social-coding/>`__
* `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkT8wMRcJok&list=PLpLblYHCzJACm0Nz8ZxmdC6F8UuSYwWGQ&index=9>`__

Jupyter
-------

Jupyter is a system for interactive computing.

* `Lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/>`__
* `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv2eGDiE3IU&list=PLpLblYHCzJACm0Nz8ZxmdC6F8UuSYwWGQ&index=11>`__

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is often the difference between reusable (or usable by
yourself in six months) and not.  We go over various ways to make
documentation much more enjoyable.

Software testing
----------------

Automatic testing is one of the cornerstones of modern software
development and without it, you often end up sending more and more
time fixing old bugs rather than doing new things.  Here, we the
concepts and simple strategies for getting started.

* `Lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/>`__
* `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s72AqTTi_Y8&list=PLpLblYHCzJACm0Nz8ZxmdC6F8UuSYwWGQ&index=14>`__
* `Q&A  <https://coderefinery.github.io/2021-05-10-workshop/questions/day6/#software-testing>`__

Modular code development
------------------------

When you can mix-and-match and reuse code, your productivity goes way
up, and that is enabled by modularity.  Here, we give a basic intro to
the concept and how to do so.

* `Lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/modular-type-along/>`__
* `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlomsX5Xm-Q&list=PLpLblYHCzJACm0Nz8ZxmdC6F8UuSYwWGQ&index=15>`__
