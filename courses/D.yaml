  questions: |
    > What are the scales of computing?
  desc: |
    Before you can use larger resources, you need to understand the
    difference from your own computers

  questions: |
    > How do you use ``module``?
    > How do you find software?
  desc: |
    Using and installing software on a cluster is different from
    your own computer, because hundreds of people are sharing it.
    Modules are the solution.

- id: D21 Batch systems
  questions: |
    > What role does the batch system fill?
    > How does one submit to the batch system?
  desc: |
    On a cluster, you have to share resources with others.  Slurm
    is one batch queuing system that makes it possible.

- id: D22 HPC Storage
  questions: |
    > Why is storage so important?
    > How can you monitor input/output (I/O) performance?
    > How to best handle your data?
  desc: |
    Storage turns out to be just as important as computing power.
    There are different places available, each with different
    advantages.

- id: D23 Parallel computing
  questions: |
    > What are the main models of parallel code?
    > How are they run on clusters?
    > How do you figure out what your code uses?
  desc: |
    The point of a cluster is to run things in parallel.  Shared
    memory (OpenMP) and message passing (MPI) are the most common models.
    Learn how to run them, not write them.
