About Linux
-----------

Linux is an operating system known for its flexibility and power.  It
doesn't hide things from the user, which makes it especially suitable
for scientific computing, where you need to assemble your own pieces
together and have full control.  Because of it's open-source spirit,
many other open-source tools are developed for it

Linux is not just one thing: there are many **distributions** which
combine software.  Which one to choose is basically user preference
(ask your friends what they use), but there are two major types:
**Debian-based** (uses ``apt`` to install programs) and **Red-hat
based** (uses ``yum`` to install programs).  In practice, Ubuntu is
a good default these days.  These instructions (so far) are for
Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.

On Ubuntu, the standard way to install things is ``sudo apt-get
install $package_names ...``



Shell tools
-----------

Every Linux distribution comes with a shell already installed.  Start
the "Terminal" or "Shell" to see it.  To verify, try running this::

  $ echo $SHELL
  /bin/bash

The convention is the ``$`` represents lines you type (without the
``$`` - notice most shell prompts have it there already), the other
lines are what comes out.

If you want a crash course on using the shell, see `the Aalto shell
crash course <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html>`_.  You
don't need this right now.



Version control (git)
---------------------

This comes included in all operating systems, but needs to be
installed.  Here, we install git and some other useful frontends for
it::

  sudo apt install git gitk gitg

Verify from the shell (see above to start the shell)::

  $ git --version
  git version 2.20.1



Anaconda (Python)
-----------------

There are very many programming languages, and you probably won't only
use Python.  But, it is quite common so we mention it here.  We
install the Anaconda distribution of Python: it gets you all the basic
things you need, and can also install R and other programming
languages, too.  Anaconda is large and has all the most common things
people need - if you want to save space, install Miniconda instead
(then you have to decide what extra packages you want).

* `Anaconda <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>`_
* `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_

This will get you Jupyter and many other Python things, too.

   Configuring it in the shell.  How to start/use it.  Easier install
   instructions.  SWC video.

To verify from the shell (see above to start the shell)::

  $ python3 -V
  Python 3.6.8 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit)

  $ conda info
       active environment : None
  ...
         base environment : /home/rkdarst/anaconda3  (writable)



Editor
------

It's good to have one command-line editor.  Make sure that ``nano`` is
installed.  If you want, you can check out `vim <>`_ or `emacs <>`_,
but they certainly harder to use so we don't recommend them to start off::

  sudo apt-get install nano

.. todo::

   Is this the most useful verification?

To verify nano from the shell (see above to start the shell)::

  $ nano my_file.txt

You should install one good **Integrated Development Environment
(IDE)**.  This has coding, version control, and many more things build
in to one interface.  These days, **VSCode** is the most popular.
Install from `the vscode website <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_.
Out of principle, we recommend you `disable data collection
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting>`_



Jupyter
-------

`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ is an interactive way to explore
data.  It's already installed along with Anaconda.  To start it in a
certain directory, go to that directory in the shell and run::

  $ jupyter notebook



Other programming tools
-----------------------

Install::

  sudo apt install build-essential meld

* ``build-essential`` installs some basic compilers and so on.
* ``meld``: A graphical diff program
